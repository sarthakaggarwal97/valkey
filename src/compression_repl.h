/* Replication compression adapter.
 *
 * This is the replication-stream counterpart to compression_rio.c: both are
 * thin adapters on top of compression_stream. compression_rio wraps a blocking
 * rio (used for RDB save/load); this file wraps the non-blocking replication
 * transport.
 *
 * Why a separate adapter: the RDB path uses the pull-mode streamReader because
 * a file rio blocks until the requested bytes are available. The replica reads
 * its primary link from a non-blocking socket inside the event loop, where a
 * read returns whatever bytes happen to be ready and a blocking pull callback
 * cannot work. The replica advertises the compression capability, but the
 * primary only compresses if its own config is enabled, so the incoming stream
 * may be compressed (VCS envelope) or plaintext. This adapter classifies the
 * stream from its leading bytes: on a VCS envelope it parses the header and
 * feeds the codec (streamDecompressorFeed) directly (the decoder retains
 * partial-frame state internally); otherwise it forwards the bytes untouched. */
